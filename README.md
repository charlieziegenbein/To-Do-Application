# To-Do-Application
This website I have created will add, delete and update a user's To-Dos in real time using a server from class. This application was built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The site can be visited at https://wustlcse204.github.io/08-todo-javascript-charlieziegenbein/. This page was created via Git-Hub pages.
